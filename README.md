# Identity Resolution Coding Exercise

Welcome to the take-home coding exercise
for the FullContact Identity Resolution team hiring pipeline. 
This is intended to be a short, straightforward exercise
to help us understand your skill level
with a few of the technologies and tasks we most frequently work with.

##### Expectations:
* **Duration**: About 1 to 4 hours
* **Subjects**: Scala, Apache Spark
* **Resources**: Yourself, existing online documentation

##### Assignment Summary

* Read **Records.txt** and **Queries.txt**
* Utilize spark to process them to produce
    * **Output1**: IDs from **Queries.txt** with records they appear in, separated by a colon
    * **Output2**: IDs from **Queries.txt** with the deduplicated union of records they appear in, separated by a colon
* Include documentation on how to run your solution from a terminal at the root of the project
* Include a test suite

## The Scaffolding

This repository includes a basic gradle buildscript,
with dependencies on scala and spark already declared.

The buildscript also includes a scalatest-based test scaffold, invokable with `./gradlew test`.
Whether you use the provided scaffold or not,
you should include a test suite invokable with `./gradlew test`.

The `application` plugin has been applied to the project so that
`./gradlew run` will invoke the `main` method of `com.fullcontact.interview.RecordFinder`,
where you can write your solution.

You may modify the buildscript and codebase as you see fit,
(_e.g._, add dependencies, add classes, move/modify/duplicate `main` method, etc.).
However, we ask that you document how to run your submission
from a terminal session at the root of the project,
whether that is by `./gradlew run` or otherwise.

We have seen, in practice, that running the project in a Windows environment
can be more challenging than on OSX or a Linux distro. Notably, PATH length
limitations on Windows make the large classpaths that build up on JVM invocations
not function properly. Workarounds exist, though we recommend using an alternative
system or a VM to run the project, if possible.

## The Scenario

In the course of our work,
we receive multiple datasets of observed, but incomplete, contact records.
_e.g._, we might have an input record of
`(bart@fullcontact.com, linkedin:lorangb, +2025551234)`,
indicating that those three pieces of contact information represent the same person.
If we later have a record of
`(bart@fullcontact.com, +2025557890)`
in addition to the first, we want to retrieve _both_ records
when searching for `bart@fullcontact.com`.

Your task is to replicate this behavior with
a small dataset and simplified matching logic.

You are provided two datasets of randomized IDs:

| Records.txt (~50k lines) |
|-------------------------------------------|
| `ZVREMGG HLLCCNX`                         |
| `BROOFJY UBXZQKD ATCZUTP`                 |
| `WONIWXW NPXNWKZ RHUJKEY QULQKGC LXZFLFQ` |
| `CFTGDGD QTBSKQW`                         |
| `MEKQMTV LOATEQG HEVOKKP YQLZEAY NPRMWRX` |
|                    ...                    |

| Queries.txt (~100k lines) |
|-------------|
|  `JKXBHJJ`  |
|  `TSZRMKP`  |
|  `HLLCCNX`  |
|  `MUXCODO`  |
|  `QIAXOON`  |
|     ...     |

The random identifiers stand in for pieces of contact information. Identifiers
are 7-character strings using the uppercase ASCII alphabet.

**Records.txt** is a file where each line is a space-separated list of IDs
indicating that those IDs were observed together in some dataset.

**Queries.txt** is a file where each line is an ID which we want to find all
associated records for.

**Given these two inputs**, create a submission
which utilizes spark in local mode to produce
two deliverable outputs:

| Output1.txt/part-00000                    |
|-------------------------------------------|
|` HLLCCNX:ZVREMGG HLLCCNX`                 |
|` LMLHENN:LMLHENN ZETNBFX`                 |
|` OOFDUJC:HAWCESV OOFDUJC MNVQEIN TJWEWHT` |
|` FSNMWAF:DJBEEPL FSNMWAF`                 |
|` FSNMWAF:FSNMWAF MLEAGKE`                 |
|                    ...                    |

| Output2.txt/part-00000                    |
|-------------------------------------------|
|` HLLCCNX:ZVREMGG HLLCCNX`                 |
|` LMLHENN:LMLHENN ZETNBFX`                 |
|` OOFDUJC:HAWCESV OOFDUJC MNVQEIN TJWEWHT` |
|` FSNMWAF:DJBEEPL FSNMWAF MLEAGKE`         |
|                    ...                    |

**Output1.txt** is a text file where each row is
an ID from **Queries.txt**,
followed by the `:` character,
followed by a row from **Records.txt** where the query ID appeared.
Query IDs _may_ appear multiple times on the left side of this output.

**Output2.txt** is a text file where each row is
an ID from **Queries.txt**,
followed by the `:` character,
followed by the deduplicated set of the union of
all IDs from rows from **Records.txt** where the query ID appeared.
Query IDs _must not_ appear multiple times on the left side of this output.

ID `FSNMWAF` demonstrates the difference between the two outputs in the samples above.


## Running the Project 

To run the project, execute this gradle command:

```base
gradle run --args="-r ./Records.txt -q ./Queries.txt  -u Output1.txt -m Output2.txt"
```
